Slow, yet powerful. One hit and, unless you have a SCP-500 or adrenaline, it's over.
The Horde is fast and gets faster. Don't let them get high numbers or it's already over.
Cardiac Attack: Makes them loose Stamina faster and take damage overtime.
Good Sense of the Doctor: You notify your target that you're targeting them, but you run faster. If they get turned, they will get 600 HP, instead of the normal 400 HP.
The Doctor’s Call: Any Zombie can see you, if they are in the same Zone as you. If a zombie stands close to you, you regenerate their hume shield.
Waste Not, Want Not: You can revive dead zombies again. Every time a zombie joins the Horde you heal 20 HP (Can overheal).
Lobotomized Bloodlust: The Horde wants more. The Horde demands their SOUL! Take whatsever left of them and rip it apart.
Voracity: You can eat a dead corpse by pressing E on it. This forces you in a animation where you cannot move. Every Corpse heals you by 100 HP (Cannot overheal).
