Disguise
Strangulation Cooldown
Skeletons In Your Closet:Your name and identity are hidden. You are but a blank canvas and the world is your muse. While disguised as a human, your basic strength allows for you to hold onto certain objects â€” but your lack of noticeable muscle prevents you from effectively using items.
Catch These Hands:Unleash a flurry of light attacks that slowly scrape health from whomever you hit. These microscopic layers of allegedly calcium-rich skin somehow give you dexterity and strengthen your resolve, restoring a small amount of Hume Shield on each hit.
Strangulation: Grab them, unequiping their current item(not charged Micros). Upon a successful kill, be granted their soul that makes you stronger. The more Souls you have, the stronger you are.
Under Their Skin: Disguise yourself as one of them! Pick any item up and drop it. This makes them trapped, if a player picks this item up they will explode, killing anyone nearby.
Press and hold [key] for longer to remove your current disguise.
