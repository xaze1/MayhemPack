Turning this feature off will remove all existing recordings of your transmissions.

<color=#8329F4>Mayhem</color> SCP-939 is blind, and sees through sound. It capitalizes on mistakes, using its silent steps and frightening speed to set up ambushes and go in for the kill.
Claw:Click to swipe your claw in a wide arc in front of you, ripping flesh and bone from your chosen victim. Whilst focusing, your primary attack will allow you to lunge at your prey.
Focus:You can see people further away and lunging will make your impact explode killing anyone nearby. This also grants you a 80% Movement Boost.
Amnestic Cloud: Makes you invisible to the people standing inside it and gives them the Irradiated Status Effect(-5%HP/s).
With Many Voices:Humans you kill have a chance at giving you their last words, allowing you to steal their voice and utilize it to deceive others. In addition, SCP-939 can also mimic some basic sounds, such as disguising their footsteps to match humans.
Ultrasensitive:SCP-939 is able to sense nearby heat sources, represented by a small radius of normal vision. Outside of this however, you must rely on sound in order to track nearby prey. The louder the sound, the further away you can hear it from. The range of your vision is affected by your stamina levels.
